# Employee-Data-Analysis-Project
This repository contains my Python capstone project, where I analyzed a dataset provided by ABC Company. The dataset consists of 458 rows and 9 columns, representing employee information across various teams.
Project Overview
The goal of this project was to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the employee data to provide ABC Company with a comprehensive report on key insights about their workforce.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data using statistical and graphical methods.

Data Visualization: Creating insightful charts and graphs to convey findings effectively.

Comprehensive Reporting: Summarizing insights on employee demographics, team distributions, performance, and other metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

Tools and Technologies

Python: For data analysis and preprocessing.

Pandas: For data manipulation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.

Google Colab: For running the code in an interactive and cloud-based environment.

Deliverables

Cleaned dataset.

Interactive visualizations.

Detailed analysis report.
